# Content

> Export your Symfony app as a static website.

Content is a static website building tool set for Symfony with specific goals:
- "You should adapt it to your need, don't adapt your needs to it".
- "It connects with standard Symfony components and feels natural to Symfony developers".

## How it works:

- Content scans your Symfony app, like a search engine crawler would, and dumps every page to static HTML.
- Content provides tools that you can use in _your_ Symfony code to load and parse static contents (such as Markdown files) into your custom PHP model objects.
- Content gives you a lot of control by providing interfaces and default implementations that are entirely replacable to suit your custom needs.

## Installation

    composer config repositories.tom32i/content vcs https://github.com/Tom32i/content.git
    composer require "tom32i/content:^1.0-dev"

## Usage

Build the static site: `bin/console -e prod content:build`

âœ¨ Your Symfony app is now a static website in: `/build`!

### In a makefile

```make
build: export APP_ENV = prod
build:
    #yarn encore production
    bin/console cache:clear
    bin/console content:build
```
